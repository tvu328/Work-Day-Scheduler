# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This work day scheduler allows you to interact with and plan your daily schedule out. You can input notes for each hour within the day, there are colors to highlight and signify between past, current, and future time. This project was built to make a busy schedule easy to organize and personally refer to. This helps with time management and organization for the day. I learned how to use day.js correctly and how local storage is effective to my code. 

## Installation 

Only step needed for this project minus cloning the starter code given, is to use the Day.js library to implement the current day at the top of the work day scheduler. 

## Usage 
To use this work day scheduler, a text input in the correct hour timebox will allow you to jot down notes or anything important for that certain hour of the scheduled day. Then, the blue save button at the end of each hour row will allow you to save that text to the local storage and it will remain on page. The note will still remain even after refreshing or closing the page. Removing the note you will have to access local storage.
